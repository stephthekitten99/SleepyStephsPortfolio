  <center>  <h1> p5.js Avatar </h1>

    <p>  When creating my avatar sketch I wanted to incorporate my daily emotions
       into my piece as my set of data points. Within this process I found that with
        a lot of external factors involved my emotions changed a lot throughout the day.
         In contrast, when I was alone the very opposite would happen, my emotions were almost stagnant.
          All of the colored tiles in the background of the piece are a representation of every
           time I changed emotion and for approximately how long they lasted. Each square was
            representative of an hour. All of this data was recorded over the span of a few days
             as I often lost track of my recording throughout the day. The quirky smiley face
             character located in the middle  of the canvas is a representation of my outward emotions.
              Being both silly, happy, and fun loving on the outside can really trap yourself inside a
              negative cycle with your own emotions. Moreover, my silly face has moving eyes that watch
               your mouse as you move around the image. In addition to all the other great things
                on the canvas so far, the image also has an overlay of twinkling sparkles because
                if you weren’t convinced enough that the smiley face is always happy a little sparkle
                is sure to fix that. Furthermore, I struggled with getting the transparency on the smiley face to work.
                   Sometimes when I load the image up it works and other times it doesn’t. Overally,
                    I am really happy with how the colors seem to be working together.
                     Though I believe the image itself could have been more detailed.
