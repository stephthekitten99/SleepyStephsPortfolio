  <center>  <h1> Lust </h1>

    <p> When thinking of the seven vices it’s quite easy to see how we are able to participate in all of them, but I found lust stuck out to me a lot. This is because when I thought about this vice I thought about how even though it is something that is seen as taboo and unspeakable in American culture it is very prominent within our media. We are sold on an idea of the perfect ideology in which we must experience lust or how we can become desirable to others. Media of this kind can be found from magazines, television shows, commercials,and even within our shopping centers. With this toxic ideology of what is advantageous to others I have often found myself reflecting on all the things that don’t fit the bill for this unattainable body image.
This piece is meant to be a form of negative campaigning against this ideology. By distorting this image of what is sexy in the media I was able to find that as fake as I knew it was I was able to solidify in my mind how counterfeit it truly was. As well as, it gave me the opportunity when the finished product was completed to really reflect on how personal lust really is. I easily found that it cannot fit in these boxes that we as a society make for literally everything.
Moreover, I specifically targeted Victoria Secret being that they have a lot of unrealistic beauty standards for the women who consume their products. In doing this I felt the best way to display this image would be to literally paste it over some of the posters found within the stores so the consumers who are being targeted with these hurtful advertisements could see just how wicked this vision of lust is.
