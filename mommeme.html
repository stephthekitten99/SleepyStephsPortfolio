  <center>  <h1> Step Meme </h1>

    <p>  In Art 74 we were assignment to make memes as a fun experience.
      Fortunately for me, at the time we were making them I was staying at
      my Dad's house. Coquencidently also at this time, my step mom (Nicole as pictured)
      was also finishing up her next college degree. In addition to, working full time,
      cleaning the house, cooking, kissing boo boos, and all of that really
      chaotic mom stuff. In this image, she is seen taking a final whilst my
      younger sister Ava was playing behind her, my Dad and brother were blaring the TV,
      and I was more than likely on my phone. With all this chaos around her she of course
      still managed to ace the test because she is awesome, but I thought the
      face she was making whilst taking her test was funny enough to photograph and
      make into a meme.
